# Milestone 4

## Introduction
Let's put aside React work for now and focus on the heart of the calculator, its logic. In this part we will implement two JavaScript modules: `calculate.js` and `operate.js` which will be responsible for all calculations. Finally, we will include those modules in the **App** component so we can hook them up to other components in the next milestone.

## Requirements

1. Preparation
   - Create a new `logic` folder inside `src` and initialize two javascript files: `calculate.js` and `operate.js`.
   - Add [Big](https://www.npmjs.com/package/big-js) package to your project dependencies.
2. Implement `calculate.js` module
   - It should contain one default method: `calculate`.
   - `calculate` method should accept a calculator data object and a button name as arguments.
   - Calculator data object should contain three properties: `total`, `next` and `operation`.
   - Using the buttonName argument, this method should mutate the calculator's data object and return its modified version.
     For instance if `buttonName == "+/-"`, it should multiply `total` and `next` by `-1` to make it negative or positive.
3. Implement `operate.js` module
   - It should import `big.js` module from the corresponding npm package.
   - It should implement one default function named `operate`.
   - `operate` function should accept `numberOne`, `numberTwo` and `operation` as arguments.
   - Using the value of the `operation` argument, this method should perform a simple math operation. For instance if `operation == "-"`, it should return the result of subtracting the two passed numbers. Remember to wrap the numbers with `big.js` classes so you can operate on big numbers.
   - If `buttonName` in `calculate.js` is equal to any operation (+, -, x, รท, %), `operate.js` should be used to
     calculate `total` property.
4. Add `calculate.js` to **App** component
   - Import `calculate` function.
