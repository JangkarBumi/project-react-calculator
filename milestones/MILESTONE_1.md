# Milestone 1

## Introduction
Every project has its beginning in tooling and this one is no different. You will build a Calculator for Math-magicians Inc.
using pre-defined React scripts, ES6 and style it with SCSS. This time we will make it a little bit easier for you because
setup will come out of the box using the `react-create-app` package.

## Requirements

1. You should use npm to initialize a new Node.js project
    - Provide a description
    - Provide server.js as the starting file
    - Check the resulting package.json file
    - Documentation: [https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)
2. You should use npm to install React and ReactDOM
    - Documentation: [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i)
3. You should add `react-scripts` as a development dependency
    - Install it and save it as a development dependency
    - Configure start, build, and test scripts in package.json
    - Documentation: [https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/react-scripts)
4. You should initialize the project directory structure
    - Create `/src` directory
    - Add `index.js` to /src directory and import React libraries there. Use ReactDOM to render basic markup: [https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)
    - Create `/public` directory
    - Add `index.html` file with basic HTML template. Make sure your html includes root selector with ID so you can attach React render to it.
